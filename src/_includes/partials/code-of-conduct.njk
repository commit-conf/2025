  <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
  <div>
    <p>
      Commit is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive event
      experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression,
      sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance,
      body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected
      category. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form.
      Commit takes violations of our policy seriously and will respond
      appropriately.
    </p>
    <p>
      All participants of Commit events must abide by the following policy:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Be excellent to each other. Treat everyone with respect. Participate
        while acknowledging that everyone deserves to be here â€” and each of us
        has the right to enjoy our experience without fear of harassment,
        discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or via
        micro-aggressions. Jokes shouldn't demean others. Consider what you are
        saying and how it would feel if it were said to or about you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Speak up if you see or hear something. We do not tolerate harassment, and
        you are empowered to politely engage when you or others are
        disrespected. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware
        of what they are doing, and politely bringing their behavior to their
        attention is encouraged.
      </li>
      <li>
        Practice saying "Yes and" to each other. It's a theatre improv technique
        to build on each other's ideas. We all benefit when we create together.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      We have a ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY for harassment of any kind, including but
      not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stalking/following</li>
      <li>Deliberate intimidation</li>
      <li>Harassing photography or recording</li>
      <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events</li>
      <li>Offensive verbal language</li>
      <li>A verbal language that reinforces social structures of domination</li>
      <li>Sexual imagery and language in public spaces</li>
      <li>Inappropriate physical contact</li>
      <li>Unwelcome sexual or physical attention</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In relation to, but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Neurodiversity</li>
      <li>Race</li>
      <li>Color</li>
      <li>National origin</li>
      <li>Gender identity</li>
      <li>Gender expression</li>
      <li>Sexual orientation</li>
      <li>Age</li>
      <li>Body size</li>
      <li>Disabilities</li>
      <li>Appearance</li>
      <li>Religion</li>
      <li>Pregnancy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
      immediately. Our zero-tolerance policy means that we will look into and
      review every allegation of violation of our Code of Conduct and respond
      appropriately. We empower and encourage you to report any behavior that
      makes you or others feel uncomfortable by finding a Commit staff member
      wearing a volunteer event shirt or by emailing
      <a href="mailto:info@commit-conf.com">info@commit-conf.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Event staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue
      security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist
      those experiencing discomfort or harassment to feel safe for the duration
      of the event. We value your attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This policy extends to talks, forums, workshops, codelabs, social media,
      parties, hallway conversations, all attendees, partners, sponsors,
      volunteers, event staff, etc. You catch our drift. Commit reserves the
      right to refuse admittance to, or remove any person from, any Commit
      hosted event (including future Commit events) at any time in its sole
      discretion. This includes, but is not limited to, attendees behaving in a
      disorderly manner or failing to comply with this policy, and the terms and
      conditions herein. If a participant engages in harassing or uncomfortable
      behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem
      appropriate, including warning or expelling the offender from the
      conference with no refund.
